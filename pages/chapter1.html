<h3>Chapter 1 - Boy and the ocean</h3>
<p>
    Once upon a stormy sea bobbed a lonely lantern light. A wooden ship – The Stalwart - tossed in the pale moonlight night.

<p>
    The amber glow of breaking clouds dappled the gray and churning sea. The mast bent against the briny breeze creaked like an ancient tree.

    The deck swarmed sparse crew, reefing sails against the waning storm. But in good cheer for they would soon be safe in the calm approaching morn. Upon the bow Everett stood A spyglass in his hand. Breathing deep the salt spray air searching for signs
    of land. His squinting search deepened as he raised the spyglass to his gaze. For on the horizon Everett could see something bobbing among the waves. Another lantern like their own, suspended in the air. Above a longboat wrecked half submerged drawing
    closer near. From broken spars a torn sheet luffed flag flapping from the stay. A red dove sigil on cotton field tossed by the violent ocean spray. "Hark men!" He cried above the wind, "Hold fast at my bequest" For two points off the starboard bow
    Everett knew a soul was in distress. The vessel turned windward beat through the dark and stormy night. Pinched close sails carved black sea towards the lonely lantern light. Everett climbed down to the deck, rapped twice the foc'sle door. Entering
    the chamber candlelight, charts strewn across the floor. Captain, off our course a boat I spied is broken in the storm. Some lonely soul I mean to save from this terrible storm The captain weary rose his head from charts upon his desk. Everett, I
    warned you not turn from our course no matter the distress. “Captain Larze!” Everett cried pointing back through the cabin door. This craft bear the mark of Larze dawned his hat and coat the ocean pitched the wooden floor. He stormed outside, Everett
    close behind and slammed the cabin door. The captain pointed to the black nimbus on the horizon to the West Beyond that stormfront lies the wicked island Levitheas.

    hello
</p>
<p>
    But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human
    happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues
    or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except
    to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
